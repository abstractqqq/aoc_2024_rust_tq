# My Solutions to Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

1. Code is not 100% optimized. 
2. Feel free to suggest improvements.

See: (Advent of code 2024)[https://adventofcode.com/2024]

## Additional Rules I follow

1. No dependencies, standard library only. Nightly compiler ok.
2. All errors must be handled or if a Result/Option is ignored, it must be explained with comment. This includes no unwrap.
